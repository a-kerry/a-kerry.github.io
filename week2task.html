	<h3>Links to portfolio pages</h3>

	<div id="menu">
		<p>*Adapt this menu and update the links to each page that you create for your portfolio. This will act as a menu for your work. e.g.*</p>
		<a href="homepage.html">Homepage</a><br>
        <a href="week1task.html">Week 1 task</a><br>
        <a href="week3task.html">Homepage</a><br>
        
		
<p>Note the use of an under construction page. This lets you set up the infrastructure of your website but without having links that do not work undermining your design!</p>
