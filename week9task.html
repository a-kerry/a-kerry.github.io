<p>
    Using the tools from the task, although all of them didnt work in practise its clear to see the given website overall wasnt very accesibly, and more could be done to improve this website. 
    <br>
    
    
    
    Similarly my website isnt overly accesible mainly due to the time constraints asscoated with addingin different acceilbity features however i can do more to reseach and add them in my final project.
As it is a highly important feature and can support making website becming succesful and practical.
