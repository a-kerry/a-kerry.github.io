	<div id="menu">
		<p>*Adapt this menu and update the links to each page that you create for your portfolio. This will act as a menu for your work. e.g.*</p>
		<a href="week1task.html">Week 1 tasks - Research Page </a><br>
		<a href="week2task.html">Week 2 tasks- Demographic Page</a><br>
		<a href="underconstruction.html">Week 3 tasks</a><br>
		<a href="underconstruction.html">Week 4 tasks</a><br>
		<a href="underconstruction.html">Week 5 tasks</a><br>
		<a href="underconstruction.html">Week 7 tasks</a><br>
		<a href="underconstruction.html">Week 8 tasks</a><br>
		<a href="underconstruction.html">Week 9 tasks</a><br>
		<a href="underconstruction.html">Week 10 tasks</a>
<p>Note the use of an under construction page. This lets you set up the infrastructure of your website but without having links that do not work undermining your design!</p>
